## What is this?
This is the proof of concept of my undergraduate final project.


## Undergraduate Final Project
My undergraduate final project at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro was about proposing a modified version of Agile methodologies for game prototype engineering aimed at individual developers, named "XS-Game". 
The goal was to adapt the useful parts of Agile and Extreme Programming that could be feasibly followed by individual developers, so workable prototypes of games could be quickly and reliably built, and if the project were to be continued or picked up by other companies, it would have already a good basis for good practices in software engineering. 
You can read more about the uses of XS-Game [here](https://pantheon.ufrj.br/bitstream/11422/17262/1/monopoli10028480.pdf) (for not, in Brazilian Portuguese only).

## So this game used that modified methodology?
That's right. Over the course of four months, I adapted the above Agile methodologies into XS-Game and followed it to create this workable game.

## Can I play this game?
Yes. For now you can clone this repository and build this with Unity. The latest version of the game was rebuilt with Unity 2020.3.0f1, so older versions may not work and newer version may require some rebuilding.

## Will you make a built version available?
I plan to, but since the final version is big (around 300MB when compressed)

## Why is the build so big?
Given the nature of the used methodology, and my own limited time for completing this project, the game was not optimized to be light, only functional. Therefore, the final size of the game was bigger than I originally anticipated. 

# How do you play?
Rules of the game:
You are a Mech who has ten minutes to leave the city block you're trapped in. You have enemy zombies and soldiers attacking you while you try to find clues in order to escape (you can hit Esc to open a Pause menu and read instructions on what clues to look for).
There are three ways to escape the city block. Each route requires multiple items, and these items can be colloected through glowing rings scattered around the city. The rings of each route have different colors. Your goal is to find the necessary items and escape the city before you're killed or the time runs out!
